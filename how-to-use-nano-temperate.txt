How to use the template

Duplicate nano-template.html → rename, e.g. nano-kinematics-average-velocity.html.

Update:

  * <title>, <meta description>, hero title/subtitle, breadcrumbs.

  * NANO_SLUG to something like kinematics-average-velocity.

  * The step titles and bodies.

  * The prompts object for that topic (at least steps 1–3).

  * Decide for each nano whether steps 4–6 stay locked (Mastery) or you make one/all of them free by:

      * changing the pill classes,

      * enabling Show prompt + Run with AI buttons and adding prompts.
